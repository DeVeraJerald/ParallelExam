Level 1
1.	Differentiate between SIMD and MIMD? Explain
-	SIMD is Single Instruction Multiple data and MIMD is Multiple Instruction and Multiple data. 
the different between this two is how many they can proccess in single run. In SIMD it can process 4 data 
in a single instruction its like computing multiple operation in a single formula but the MIMD can proccess 
multiple operations and compute it in different kind of formula.


2.	What are the performance metrics of parallel systems? Explain each.
-	speedup is a statistic that compares the performance of two systems working on the same issue.

-	Efficiency is a measure of how much computing capability is being used. It evaluates the 
relationship between performance and resource availability available to attain that level of performance

-	Execution Time is the time that elapses from the moment a parallel computation starts to the moment
the last processing element finishes execution

-	Total parallel overhead is the total amount of time spent by all processors on non-productive tasks


3.	How does the performance of metrics of parallel systems affect each other? Explain.
-	It affects the performance of the parallel system because it can reduce the time of processing by reducing the non-productive task in processors

4.	Explain what pipelining is
-	Pipelining is splitting the task into each available processor. 
for example is a Group project that you want to submit early so every member is a 
processor and the task is the project. to submit it early you need to split the task among 
every member so that it can finish early and submit it.

5.	Illustrate and explain what a Von Neuman Architecture is.
-	Von Neumann architecture is a computer architecture that contains 
Input and Output it has CPU or central processing unit that contains control 
and unit arithmetic logic unit, and it has a memory unit.
